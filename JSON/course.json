For example, if you were making a program for a dog shelter, a Dog would be a good class to make so that someone can log the dog into the shelter's system. The class would contain the dog's name, breed, and age. These would be established as variables. So when you create an instance of a dog, or in other words want to add a dog, you will need to enter a name, breed, and age. Since the class is created, you can make instances of as many dogs as you need to."}]}]},{"difficulty":"EASY","syllabus":"Module 1: Basic","comments":[],"reviews":[],"author":"f171beda-c466-49a7-8b83-62a5c78264b3","name":"Python","rating":0.0,"description":"Learning Python as a beginner","students":[],"language":"PYTHON","id":"01369bf1-f05c-43da-ab10-d708e7407a11","modules":[{"comments":[],"name":"Bais","lesson":[{"quiz":[{"question":"how would you print your name in python?","answers":["System.out.println(your name);","System.out.print(your name);","print(your name)","cout << your name;"],"correctAnswer":2}],"title":"hello world","content":"learning how to print hello world. print(hello world)."}]},{"comments":[],"name":"for","lesson":[{"quiz":[{"question":"what","answers":["for","wah","idk","meh"],"correctAnswer":1}],"title":"for","content":"for"}]},{"comments":[],"name":"While","lesson":[{"quiz":[{"question":"what is while loop?","answers":["idk","meh","while loop","wht"],"correctAnswer":2}],"title":"while loop","content":"while loop"},{"quiz":[{"question":"what","answers":["wht","idk","mah","meh"],"correctAnswer":2}],"title":"for","content":"for"}]}]}]
