For example, if you were making a program for a dog shelter, a Dog would be a good class to make so that someone can log the dog into the shelter's system. The class would contain the dog's name, breed, and age. These would be established as variables. So when you create an instance of a dog, or in other words want to add a dog, you will need to enter a name, breed, and age. Since the class is created, you can make instances of as many dogs as you need to."}]}]},{"difficulty":"EASY","syllabus":"Module 1: Basic","comments":[],"reviews":[],"author":"f171beda-c466-49a7-8b83-62a5c78264b3","name":"Python for Beginners","rating":0.0,"description":"Learning python as beginner","students":[],"language":"PYTHON","id":"d3e344c5-5456-44b8-bb2c-33152968c4a6","modules":[{"comments":[],"name":"Basic","lesson":[{"quiz":[{"question":"What command do you use to print in Python?","answers":["System.out.println();","System.out.print();","print()","cout<<"],"correctAnswer":2}],"title":"Hello World","content":"A String is a collection of character like numbers and letters.
